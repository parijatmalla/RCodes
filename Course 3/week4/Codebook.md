## Processing Steps:

1. All the required data files were loaded into separate tables.
2. Column names for the training and test data set were derived respectively.
3. Only the mean and standard deviation were extracted from them.
4. Added activities details to the training and test data set.
5. Added subject details to the training and test data set.
6. Merged training and test data set.
7. Clear descriptive labels were added to the data set and saved under tidy_data.txt file.
8. Average values for each of the variables were derived for each subject and activity from tidy data set and saved as a new file called aggregate_UCI_mean_tidy_data.txt
